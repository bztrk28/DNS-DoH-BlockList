Why did I create this instead of using the original link? 
Because the configuration in the company I work for was different. So I created this list according to our internal network. The rules here are entirely based on the company’s own DNS structure. There may be links that do not comply with your policy. Please be careful when using it.

Do you think there is a mistake or a violation? Please send me a message. You can be sure that I will make the necessary correction.
